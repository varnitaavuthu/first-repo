# first-repo
my first repository on GitHub

My name is Varnita. I am from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, in the Department of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy a wide range of activities including dancing, drawing, and sports. Being a wildlife lover and nature enthusiast, I am definitely outdoorsy. Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring, learning, and growing over the next four years.

Git was a new concept to me and I loved everything it has to offer- the ease of use, the structured workflow, and how it allows users to review and discuss before they merge different versions. I can't wait to start collaborating with people while working on bigger projects on GitHub.

Among all the Python assignment problem that were given, I must say I enjoyed "Prime Code Breaker" the most. We were suppposed to find out if a given number is prime and then also find the next prime number. The code for the second half was kinda tricky. I remember spending three hours trying to fix the last part of my code in order to produce desired outputs until I learnt I needed to used something called "Flag". (Incase you're wondering, I did submit the assignment late.)
